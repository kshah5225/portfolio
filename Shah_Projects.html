                <h6><strong>Project</strong>: VEX Robotics Competition-StarStruck</h6>
                <h6><strong>Duration</strong>: one year</h6>
                <h6><strong>Objective</strong>: Build a robot that throws foam stars and cubes over a fence as fast as possible</h6>
                <h6><strong>Type of Project</strong>: Team Project</h6>
                <p>
                    In this project I was mainly a builder. My Job was to Build and upkeep our robot over time as well as be able to come up with solutions to problems before they even happen. 
                    This Project is a Competition between many different teams arround the world, all whom follow <a href='documents/Starstruck-Game-Manual.pdf'> THIS </a> rule book which describes 
                    how points will be counted as well as defines what you can and cannot do to create your robot. We have documented our entire design progress throught the year
                    <a href='documents/5327D_Notebook.pdf'> HERE. </a> You can see the Reveal for our Final Robot for this season <a href='https://youtu.be/JbH_C_RBvvk'> HERE. </a> In this project many
                    people from different backrounds came together to form a well rounded team. We need many different types of people such as Programmers, Builders, Computer aided designers, 
                    Documentors, and many more sub catagories exist.
