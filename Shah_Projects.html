                    <h6><strong>Project</strong>: Python Image Manipulation</h6>
                    <h6><strong>Duration</strong>: 3 weeks</h6>
                    <h6><strong>Objective</strong>: Make a program that can adjust and apply filters,logos, and watermarks to many images at once.</h6>

                    <p>
                        For the major Duration of this project's timeline for 
                        the first 2.5 weeks I mainly wrote and tested code and 
                        during the last 3 days of this project I aided in 
                        marketing material and documentation of ths project. I 
                        did this project in accordance to 
                        <a href='documents/Image_Artist.pdf'> THIS </a>
                        rubric and complying to Client #2. While progressing in 
                        this project we Logged all we did and all our thought 
                        processes which can be found 
                        <a href='documents/Image_artist_Documentation.pdf'> HERE</a>.
                        An example of my code working can be seen on the right 
                        but more examples of my code working can be seen by

                        Throught this project I worked with other people with 
                        varying amounts of knowledege of different APIs and in 
                        we ended up with a very sucessful and usable product 
                        using only a few APIs.

                    <h6><strong>Project</strong>: VEX Robotics Competition-StarStruck</h6>
                    <h6><strong>Duration</strong>: one year</h6>
                    <h6><strong>Objective</strong>: Build a robot that throws foam stars and cubes over a fence as fast as possible</h6>

                    <p>
                        In this project I was mainly a builder. My Job was to Build and upkeep our robot over time as well as be able to come up with solutions to problems before they even happen. 
                        This Project is a Competition between many different teams arround the world, all whom follow <a href='documents/Starstruck-Game-Manual.pdf'> THIS </a> rule book which describes 
                        how points will be counted as well as defines what you can and cannot do to create your robot. We have documented our entire design progress throught the year
                        <a href='documents/5327D_Notebook.pdf'> HERE. </a> You can see the Reveal for our Final Robot for this season <a href='https://youtu.be/JbH_C_RBvvk'> HERE. </a> In this project many
                        people from different backrounds came together to form a well rounded team. We need many different types of people such as Programmers, Builders, Computer aided designers, 
                        Documentors, and many more sub catagories exist.
