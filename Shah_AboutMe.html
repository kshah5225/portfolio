                        Hello,  My name is Kunal Shah and I aspire to be a robotics engineer. I plan to get a 4.0 grade
                        point average then apply to "Carnegie Mellon". To assist this choice of college I have a good 
                        reputation in the VEX robotics scene. I am part of the Dublin Gael force robotics club 5327A team.
                        We are a well known team and last year we had 3 out of 5 teams from our club go to worlds 
                        tournament. This year we are well on our way to make it to worlds for worlds with a tournaments 
                        champions award from a prestigious tournament that has qualified us to go to states and later we 
                        qualified th the worlds championship for VEX robotics.
                    </br>
                    <br>
                        Going to carnegie mellon is my goal because they are a well known college for robotics. Going to
                        this college will allow me to pursue my greater goal/passion which is creating robots for almost
                        any reason. I love making robots then at the end it is amazing to see something you make evolve 
                        until it has become its final astounding form that you worked so hard to accomplish. That final 
                        form that you can give to the world and help others who need or want what you made. That I why I 
                        love to do robotics.
                    </br>
                    <br>
                        I am very good at decision making. This is shown in robotics when I can be given many different 
                        mechanisms I can determine what to use and all the pros and cons of each mechanism and how to work 
                        around those cons. I am also am persistent which is shown In my robotics team because I won't give
                        up even after everyone else has when there is a problem with no easy solution. I am also very 
                        focused at what is important at the moment. If There is something that needs to be done I won't 
                        pick up my phone or watch TV until I am done with all my homework.
                    </br>
                    <br>
                        My biggest accomplishments are First Lego league(FLL) champions award, VEX champions award 2 years 
                        in a row, building a computer and building 2 drones. I am a good team leader as I was the 
                        Team captain of my FLL team and a sort of co-captain in my VEX robotics team. When even the real
                        team captain does not know what to do I step in and help by telling our team captain what to do.
                        In fact both years I built the full final version of the robot due to the captain being on break. 
                        When the captain isn't here I am instructing the team on what to do.

                        Being a part of FLL and VEX taught me many things. VEX and FLL taught me that theoretical is 
                        almost never realistic in terms of efficiency, torque, speed and many more calculated things. It 
                        also taught me leadership skills and how to efficiently run the team like how it is best to solve
                        others problems first so that everyone stays focused and is running at 100% for 100% of time. I
                        have also come to realize that almost nothing else matters other than dedication if you are 
                        looking for a good member to a team.
